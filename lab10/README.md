## Lab 10 AspectJ Gumball Machine

For the solution in Lab 1 I have to explicitly instantiate three GumballMachine objects, one for each type. Then I have to test all of them in one program run, meaning that some code needed to be repeated in the Main class. As for the FeatureIDE/AspectJ solution I only need to set the configuration of the Feature Model for testing each machine type. This means that I have to run three tests instead of just one, but I still get separate outputs.
